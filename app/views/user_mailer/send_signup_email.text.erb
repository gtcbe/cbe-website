Hello <%= @user.name %> and thank you for joining the Contraband Empire family!

Everybody here at the Contraband Empire Development Team is incredibly excited to have YOU on board!

We know we still have a long way to go, but with your help, your suggestions and your feedback, we are confident that Contraband Empire will be the amazing experience that you deserve.

To get you started, here are a few helpful tips:
1. If you haven't done so already, read through the <%= link_to "Wiki", wiki_url %> to get a better understanding of how the game will work.
2. See something you think needs improvement? Leave a comment! Your feedback will help us improve the game (and earn you some sweet rewards)!
3. Rate and comment on other people's suggestions. The more people get behind an idea, the more likely we are to implement it.
4. Keep up to date with the latest news and changes via our <%= link_to "Blog", blog_url %>

We hope you are as excited about this journey as we are. It's the first time we get the chance to develop a game not just for our players, but with them.
So thanks again for giving us this opportunity and for coming along on the ride.
